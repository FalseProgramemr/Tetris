**In this project, I recreated Tetris in C++ using the ncurses library. **

This project presents the implementation of a Tetris game clone using the ncurses library.

## Installation

How to run the Tetris game:

:Download the code:
 
-Download the ZIP file of the Tetris project from GitHub.

-Navigate to the folder where you extracted the Tetris code using the cd command.                                 
-Run the make command to compile the code.
